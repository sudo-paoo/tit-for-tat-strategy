# Prisoner's Dilemma Game

This Java program simulates the classic game theory scenario known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. Two players can choose to cooperate or betray each other, earning points based on their choices. The game consists of two opponents: Tit-For-Tat, Friedman, and Randoomed.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Opponent:**

   - Tit-For-Tat (Enter 1)
   - Friedman (Enter 2)
   - Random (Enter 3)

2. **Game Rules:**

   - The game involves two players.
   - Each player can choose to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).
   - The game runs for 10 rounds.
   - Players earn points based on the following rules:
     - If both players cooperate, they each get 3 points.
     - If both players defect, they each get 1 point.
     - If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets 5 points, and the cooperator gets nothing.
   - At the end of 10 rounds, the player with the highest total points wins.

3. **Game Flow:**

   - Input your move for each round (C for Cooperate, D for Defect).
   - The program displays the moves, updates logic information for the chosen opponent, and calculates scores.

4. **End of Game:**
   - At the end of the game, the scores are displayed, and the winner (Computer or Player) is determined.
